# VGG16-Bone-Fracture-Detection
Developed a computer vision model using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called VGG16 to detect bone fractures (Tibia and Fibula) from medical X-ray images. The system performs image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification to distinguish fractured vs. non-fractured bones.
